    <h class="head">Blockchain and Industry use case</h>
    <h1 class="heading">When you start a
        discussion about the blockchain technology, many people like to say that they
        still haven’t seen a working implementation in an industry, except for
        cryptocurrencies. Well, here we leave the theoretical path and show cases
        that are actually in use today. While there is still work to be done on the
        blockchain technology, this hasn’t stopped industry leaders from implementing
        the technology and changing the way they work.</h>
        <h2 class="heading ">
            * Blockchain and Finance</h2>
    <p class="para">
       With its very nature set in finance, blockchain technology can offer various
      solutions in the world of finance to improve existing markets or help create
      entirely new ones, depending on the use case and the creativity of those
      willing to investigate the opportunities. However you look at it, distributed
      data storages can help facilitate how data is provided in real-time to all parties
      that wish to participate in the market. This way there can no longer be a
      discussion about who has access to market data in a fair manner. Marketplaces
      could be created where assets are traded over the blockchain platform, just
      as crowdfunding solutions that allow for smaller projects and companies to
      find funding. Assets can be transferred in a way that is transparent to all
      participants, easily verifiable, and cost-effective. Clearing and settlement
      processes can be fully automated and logged when using smart contracts.  
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For the regulators, trade surveillance should no longer prove to be an issue,
      with clear and immutable logs of each transaction. Money transfers can happen
      without the interference of third parties that claim their share of the
      transaction. Interbank payments could happen smoothly without time being
      lost and data could once again be shared with interoperable systems. Financial
      inclusions could be achieved for those that have no access to financial services
      and are left in the cold by the current institutions. By allowing these individuals
      to partake in these processes, we could provide them with better lives and
      ways of living. Foreign exchange, just as any other form of payment system,
      could happen over distributed ledgers, improving the current legacy systems
      that are in place and again eliminating the third parties that take their share.     
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Entire loan markets could be facilitated over blockchain platforms. People
      who currently have no access to loans and are left to the sharks that profit
      from their misery could find a sustainable solution by using microloans or new
      types of contracts that are built to their needs. The letter of credit is also a
       classic bank product for business partners all over the world to work and
      trade with each other. Again, blockchain technology could help to optimize
      and automate existing processes and reduce costs. There have also been talks,
      startups, and applications that focus on the creation of derivatives, margin
      calls, CDS, swaps, and stocks. The possibilities are endless, depending on how
      you look at current processes or what you can imagine for new products.
    
    <h3 class="heading">1) The Finance Department : </h3>
    <p1 class="para"> It might be interesting to take a look at the finance department and spot the
        opportunities within the confines of this department. As always, every project
        impacts other departments and the company as a whole. However, you can
        easily see that when you start projects within that same finance department,
        you can use them as a center of innovation, which in turn can change the
        entire organization. By the very nature of the technology, this could even
        include the supply chain, the suppliers, and the customers.</p1>
