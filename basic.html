        confusing array of metaphors and definitions all of which attempt to
        “define” the term. What the best responses to this query agree on: a
        blockchain is a decentralized database that coordinates agreement on an
        append-only history of transactions across a peer-to-peer network. This
        definition contains some very complex ideas that will require a fair
        amount of effort to unpack.</p

      <h2 class="heading">Elements of a Blockchain:</h2>
      <p1 class="para">Throughout this discussion of blockchain technology, there have
        been many mentions of different components of a blockchain
        application such as nodes, community of verifiers, and peer-to-
        peer network. At times this can be confusing because it is unclear
        who plays which role in a typical blockchain. Let’s dive deeper into
        some of the roles and functions that go into blockchain
        architecture.</p1>
        <h3 class="heading">Nodes:</h3>
     <p2 class="para">
      Any computer connecting to a blockchain network is a node
participating in the network. Now if you want to be a more active
participant in the blockchain and become a member of the
“community of verifiers,” you have to become a full node. To
become a full node, you must have a computer (hardware)
connected to a blockchain network and you must download a
complete copy of the blockchain (software) onto your computer. As
of the writing of this text, the size of the Bitcoin blockchain
download was over 200 GB and growing. It could take several days to download 
a complete copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. A full node
includes the complete copy of the blockchain and also works to
fully validate both the transactions and the blocks. To operate as a
full node on a blockchain application certainly requires a high-
powered computer setup, including lots of Remote Access Memory
(RAM), large quantities of free space on your hard drive, and a
good broadband connection. One user can operate multiple nodes
on a blockchain, and there also exist “partial nodes” that point to
full nodes for their data.
     </br>
    </br>
     In order for blockchain applications to grow, it is very important that
there are a lot of nodes on the network. The more independent
nodes there are, the more control of the network is decentralized
and replicated, fostering greater blockchain security. Some people
and organizations volunteer to use their spare computing resources
to help run a blockchain by functioning as full nodes. These full
nodes are what we referred to earlier as the “peer-to-peer network”
because they have agreed to take on the role of verifying that
transactions and blocks are accurate.
     </p2>
     <h4 class="heading">Blocks:</h4>
     <p3 class="para">Any full node participating on a blockchain can gain the right to
      package the transactions as they occur into a block. As a
      reference point, blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain are currently
      about 1 MB in size and take about ten minutes to create. Once a
      block is created, it is linked to the previous block using a special
      address as well as cryptography. Grouping these connected blocks
      into a chain is why the database is called a blockchain, and it
      represents a chronological history of all the events that occurred in
      the network. Looking at transactions in a blockchain you will mostly
      see numbers and letters, representing the alphanumeric address
      associated with the transaction, as well as the hash (or
      compression) of the previous blocks.</p3>
      <h5 class="heading">Public and Private Keys:</h5>
     <p4 class="para">The ability to use addresses when transacting on a blockchain
      allows the network to verify transactions without necessarily
      revealing lots of personal information. Instead, asymmetric
cryptography built into the blockchain system allows individuals to
use a private key to unlock their address while only sharing a public
key with the others involved in the transaction. Essentially,
transactions on a blockchain transfer value between public keys. It
is this combination of transparency and public-key identities that
ensures that users maintain their “trust” in the transactions logged
on the blockchain system. You can think of these as analogous to a
safety deposit box at a bank – to unlock the box, there is the bank’s
key (public) and the customer key (private) that only the customer
has access to. Similarly, with an address on a blockchain network,
you have a public portion of your account address and a private
portion that allows you (and only you) to unlock access to it for
making transactions. To perform transactions on a blockchain, you
need to digitally sign your transactions with your private key.

    <h6 class="heading">Mining:</h6>
     <p5 class="para">As part of the “community of verifiers,” a full node helps validate a
      blockchain database through a practice called mining. Miners are
      nodes that perform a certain amount of computational work –
      racing with each other to solve a mathematical puzzle – in order to
      help keep the network going. Every time a miner successfully
      solves the puzzle, they win the right to contribute the newest block
      of transactions to the blockchain. The winning miner sends out a
      message to the entire network, and receives newly minted tokens
      as an incentive in exchange for the service of helping maintain the
      database by mining.
    </p5>
      
    <h6 class="heading">Tokens or Coins:</h6>
    <p5 class="para">One of the ingenious things about blockchain technology is that it
      was developed using some elements of game theory and
      economics. In order to motivate people to participate in a
      blockchain as a full node and help secure the history of
      transactions in the database, these systems include an incentive
      structure that uses “digital tokens.” A digital token is just a way of
      representing value on a blockchain application.
